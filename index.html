    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <div class="intro">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a
            document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or
            XHTML).
            CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
            This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its
            presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics;
            enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which
            reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to
            improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
        <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
            styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or
            screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the
            content is accessed on a mobile device. </p>
        <p>The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to
            determine which declaration applies if more than one declaration of a property match a particular element.
            This cascading priority scheme is predictable.</p>

        <h2>Syntax: </h2>
        <p>A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors and
            a declaration block.</p>
        <h3>Selector</h3>
        <p>In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in
            the
            markup itself.</p>
        <h3>Selector types</h3>
        <p>Selectors may apply to the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2</li>
            <li>elements specified by attribute, in particular
                <ul>
                    <li>id: an identifier unique within the document, denoted in the selector language by a hash
                        prefix
                        e.g. #id</li>
                    <li>lass: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document, denoted by a dot
                        prefix
                        e.g. .classname</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.</li>
            <p>Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters,
                hyphens,
                and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any element. An ID may only be
                applied
                to a single element.</p>
        </ul>
        <h3>Pseudo-classes</h3>
        <p>Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained
            in
            the document tree.</p>
        <p>One example of a widely used pseudo-class is :hover, which identifies content only when the user "points
            to"
            the visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to a selector as in
            a:hover
            or #elementid:hover.</p>
        <p>A pseudo-class classifies document elements, such as :link or :visited, whereas a pseudo-element makes a
            selection that may consist of partial elements, such as ::first-line or ::first-letter. Note the
            distinction
            between the double-colon notation used for pseudo-elements and the single-colon notation used for
            pseudo-classes.</p>
